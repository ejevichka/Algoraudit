# 🔍 Algoraudit — AI-Powered Algorand Smart Contract Auditor

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fejevichka%2FAlgoraudit)

Algoraudit is an AI-powered tool that analyzes Algorand smart contracts, explains their behavior in plain language, highlights security risks with severity levels, and suggests improvements with clear references to the underlying TEAL code.

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 **Comprehensive Contract Analysis**
- **Plain-Language Summary**: Understand what your contract does without diving into TEAL code
- **Key Functions**: Identify primary actions and methods available to users
- **Actors & Permissions**: See who can call critical functions and what special privileges exist
- **State Changes**: Track what global and local state variables the contract modifies

### 🛡️ **Security Risk Detection**
- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Detects common security issues in TEAL code
- **Severity Classification**: Risks categorized as Low, Medium, High, or Critical
- **Detailed Explanations**: Plain-language descriptions of what attackers could exploit
- **Code References**: Pinpoints specific TEAL opcodes that trigger warnings

### 💡 **Actionable Recommendations**
- **Remediation Guidance**: Clear, AI-generated suggestions to fix vulnerabilities
- **Best Practices**: Recommendations based on Algorand security standards
- **Code Examples**: Specific improvements with references to problematic code sections

### 🚀 **Easy to Use**
- **Simple Interface**: Just paste an Algorand application ID
- **Real-time Analysis**: Get results in seconds
- **Structured Output**: Clean, organized reports with clear sections
- **No Setup Required**: Works directly with mainnet contracts

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Input**: Provide an Algorand smart contract application ID
2. **Fetch**: Automatically retrieves the contract's approval program from Algonode
3. **Analyze**: AI processes the TEAL code using advanced security auditing techniques
4. **Report**: Generates a comprehensive audit report with findings and recommendations

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **AI Engine**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini with structured output
- **Blockchain Data**: Algonode API for contract retrieval
- **Deployment**: Vercel Edge Functions for fast, global performance

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ejevichka/Algoraudit.git
   cd Algoraudit
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Add your OpenAI API key:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Contract Audit

1. Go to the **Structured Output** page
2. Enter an Algorand application ID (e.g., `123456789`)
3. Click **Send** to start the analysis
4. Review the generated audit report

### Understanding the Report

The audit report includes:

- **Summary**: High-level explanation of the contract's purpose
- **Key Functions**: List of available actions and methods
- **Actors & Permissions**: Who can perform what actions
- **State Changes**: What data the contract modifies
- **Risk Detection**: Security issues found during analysis
- **Vulnerability Details**: Detailed findings with severity levels and recommendations

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key for AI analysis | Yes |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO` | Set to "true" to disable ingestion features | No |

### Customization

You can customize the audit prompts and analysis criteria by modifying:
- `app/api/chat/structured_output/route.ts` - Main audit logic and prompts
- `components/ChatMessageBubble.tsx` - Report display formatting

## 🌐 Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. **Connect your repository** to Vercel
2. **Set environment variables** in Vercel dashboard:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
3. **Deploy** - Vercel will automatically build and deploy your app

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build the application
yarn build

# Start production server
yarn start
```
